## Bugs
* Do ALU operations need to be signed?

## Sam's notebook
* need to create block symbol for shifter/rotator
* do I need to shift right/left by certain amounts? ie. should there be two inputs?

## Bulletin Board
## Phase 1
## Work to Be Done
### Components 
  * ALU
    * MUL
      * Array MUL
      * Booth MUL
      * *BONUS* Booth w/Bit Pair Recoding
    * DIV
    * AND
    * OR
    
### Macro Work
* Connect Bus to ALU  

## Work in Progress
* SHR/SHL (S)
* Connect Arithmetic Components within ALU (S)
* Connect all registers to Bus & check that they are wired properly (S)
## Work to be Tested
* Enclose BusMux with Encoder into CPU_Bus (S)
* Connect MDR register to the bus (S)


## Work Completed
* BusMux
* Bus Encoder
* 32 bit Register
* MDR
* ADD/SUB
